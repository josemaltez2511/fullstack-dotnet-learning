Today's Journal Entry
Wow, what a day! I feel like I'm really starting to put the pieces together on my ASP.NET project. I started by tackling a bug that was giving me a "Pirce" error in my SQL query—it was just a simple typo, but it taught me to pay close attention to the small details.

From there, I took a massive leap forward by implementing Dependency Injection (DI) using Unity. I learned that DI isn't just a buzzword; it's a critical way to achieve loose coupling in my code. Instead of my controller creating its own repository, Unity now injects it, making my code much more professional and testable.

Then, I focused on adding the Delete functionality to complete the full CRUD cycle. I had to create a new method in my repository and two controller actions—one to show a confirmation page and another to perform the actual deletion. It was a great lesson in why it's so important to ask for user confirmation before deleting data!

The biggest "aha!" moment came from understanding the relationship between Software Architecture, Design Patterns, and Algorithms. I realized they are not the same thing, but a top-down hierarchy: architecture is the overall strategy, design patterns are the component blueprints, and algorithms are the specific, step-by-step instructions. And to top it off, I learned about the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and fixed a duplicate method to make my code cleaner.

I'm really proud of the progress I'm making. Each step feels more solid and intentional, and I'm not just coding, I'm building with purpose.
